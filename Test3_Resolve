1. Get rid of packages that are no longer required [Recommended]
#sudo apt-get autoremove

2. Clean up APT cache in Ubuntu
#sudo du -sh /var/cache/apt 

#sudo apt-get autoclean
(OR)
#sudo apt-get clean

3. Clean the thumbnail cache
#du -sh ~/.cache/thumbnails
#rm -rf ~/.cache/thumbnails/*

4. Remove old Linux kernels that were manually installed 
#sudo dpkg --list 'linux-image*'
#sudo apt-get remove linux-image-VERSION

5. Remove orphaned packages  
#sudo apt-get install gtkorphan

6. Uninstalling unnecessary applications [Recommended]
#sudo apt-get remove package-name1 package-name2

7. Find and remove duplicate files

8. Remove older versions of Snap applications  

#du -h /var/lib/snapd/snaps
4.0K    /var/lib/snapd/snaps/partial
5.6G    /var/lib/snapd/snaps

To create a new shell script and use the following lines in my script:

#!/bin/bash
# Removes old revisions of snaps
# CLOSE ALL SNAPS BEFORE RUNNING THIS
set -eu
snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}' |
    while read snapname revision; do
        snap remove "$snapname" --revision="$revision"
    done

Give it execute permission, run it with sudo and see the magic. The script removed the older Snap packages and freed over half of the 5 GB space used by Snap.

du -h /var/lib/snapd/snaps
4.0K    /var/lib/snapd/snaps/partial
2.5G    /var/lib/snapd/snaps

9. Using GUI tools to free space in Ubuntu
Stacer is one such tool that we could use.

10.Alternately,If we are using VMware VM or AWS instance or MSAzure VM we can suggest to the customer/Application owner and can be increased the disk space online
