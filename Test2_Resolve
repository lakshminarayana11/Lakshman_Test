Step # 1 Find Out PID
To find out PID for mysqld process, enter:
# ps aux | grep mysqld

OR
# pidof mysqld

Output:

28290
Step # 2 List File Opened By a PID # 28290
Use the lsof command or /proc/$PID/ file system to display open fds (file descriptors), run:
# lsof -p 28290
# lsof -a -p 28290

OR
# cd /proc/28290/fd
# ls -l | less

You can count open file, enter:
# ls -l | wc -l

Tip: Count All Open File Handles
To count the number of open file handles of any sort, type the following command:
# lsof | wc -l

Sample outputs:

5436
List File Descriptors in Kernel Memory
Type the following command:
# sysctl fs.file-nr

Sample outputs:

fs.file-nr = 1020	0	70000
Where,

1020 The number of allocated file handles.
0 The number of unused-but-allocated file handles.
70000 The system-wide maximum number of file handles.
You can use the following to find out or set the system-wide maximum number of file handles:
# sysctl fs.file-max

Sample outputs:

fs.file-max = 70000
See how to set the system-wide maximum number of file handles under Linux for more information.


To resolve the issue,use below commands:

#ls -l | wc -l		 

#kill -9 `lsof -t -u username/admin 




More about /proc/PID/file & procfs File System
/proc (or procfs) is a pseudo-file system that it is dynamically generated after each reboot. It is used to access kernel information. procfs is also used by Solaris, BSD, AIX and other UNIX like operating systems. Now, you know how many file descriptors are being used by a process. You will find more interesting stuff in /proc/$PID/file directory:

/proc/PID/cmdline : process arguments
/proc/PID/cwd : process current working directory (symlink)
/proc/PID/exe : path to actual process executable file (symlink)
/proc/PID/environ : environment used by process
/proc/PID/root : the root path as seen by the process. For most processes this will be a link to / unless the process is running in a chroot jail.
/proc/PID/status : basic information about a process including its run state and memory usage.
/proc/PID/task : hard links to any tasks that have been started by this (the parent) process.
